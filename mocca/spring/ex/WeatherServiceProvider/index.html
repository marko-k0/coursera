  <h3>Weather Service App (P2 - Assignment 3)</h3>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Weather Service App</h4>

<P> 

The purpose of this "mini-project" assignment is to give you experience 
using Android to develop a complete Weather Service app using the 
Retrofit library, Android's Content Providers, and a SQLite database. 
Retrofit is used to obtain weather information from a Weather Service web 
service, and this data is then stored in a timeout cache that uses a 
database-backed Content Provider for storage. The user will provide a location as a 
String (such as "Nashville, TN"), and a WeatherData object will be 
returned to the WeatherActivity that can be used to display various 
current weather-related information for that location.

Retrofit is covered in the following videos:

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment3">[*Update with correct location*]</a>.
    Pull the appropriate skeleton code into your repository, 
    read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers, 
    which reside in the following Java source files: [*Update with correct files*].
    
    </p> 
    <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this assignment. 
        Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can successfully 
        access and store the weather data from the server. However, 
        make sure your program works for both valid and invalid input. 
        </p>

<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p>

This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding with
the Retrofit library and Android's Content Providers.
It's highly recommended to watch the videos
listed above and look at the Acronym example <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/ex">[*Update location*]</A>
to gain a better understanding of how to structure your solution.
Start early and come to Virtual Office Hours if you have questions or
run into problems.  </p>
